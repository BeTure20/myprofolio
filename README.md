The application is myresume app, that shows my details; description, about, work experience, work portfolio
Features:

<!-- - Light/dark mode - the application can switch between light and dark mode. -->

- Responsiveness - it can fit in any screen size
<!-- - Functional social media links -->

## Description of the code:

The resumepage folder contains all the app screens of the resume,the inc folder contain all the reuseable code like size_config,my defualt color that i used in the project

Finally the assets folder housed all the images I used in the development of the app.

## Design Description

i got the design inspiration from https://dribbble.com/shots/14436103-Resume-App.
the design currently is a one page app with three Scroll pages

## Library used:

- MediaQuery for Responsiveness
- Fontawesome for Font Icon

## More features:

- I will like to implement the remaining blank screens e.g. Resume, Portifolio etc. when I have the time, probably add cool animations to the app.
- I will love to add Dark mode and language translation
